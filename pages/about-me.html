              Hi, my name is Marvin ! <br />
              A recent computer engineering graduate from Epita. I am currently
              looking for a next role as a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for frontend development stemmed from a deep love of
              sharing and showing my projects to friends and family. What will
              always have the biggest impact for the user (here my family) would
              be the interface. It is truly the display of all of the work
              behind an application and it also doesn't hurt that you are able
              to have a direct visual feedback of your work. And it's this
              positive feedback as well as a love of trying out interfaces and
              figuring out what works and what doesn't and for what reason, that
              I made the decision to specialize myself in frontend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have utilized my skills through projects and internships. I used
              my knowledge of the design tool Figma and general UI knowledge to
              redesign the app I worked on in my SNCF internship but also for
              the different project I did. Of course my coding knowledge was of
              great importance to carry out work, especially for my internship
              at KPMG working on a workflow SaaS management solution where both
              visuals and performance was of great importance. I worked on
              project using React native, React, Python, HTML, CSS and
              JavaScript for my frontend work. But I also have knowledge in SQL,
              API building and databases that I acquired before my
              specialization and reinforced some in frontend projects by
              utilizing APIs. But there isn't only code in the life of an
              engineer and as such I also greatly worked on my interpersonal
              skills especially during my internship.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am interested in learning more about frontend development be it
              new frameworks, best practices or consolidating my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I like to explore new parts of Paris, especially
              parks, assembling and painting plastic models and traveling.
